# Fundamentals-of-Digitals-Project

 Ecommerce (shopee)
- Vendor journey (how small sellers moved from traditional market → digital store)
- Clayton Christensen’s Disruptive Innovation Model
- Stage 1: Vendors relied on pasar malam, local kedai runcit. Limited customers, no
online exposure.
- Stage 2 : Lazada/eBay were available but expensive and hard for micro vendors to
join.
- Stage 3 : Shopee launched free-to-join platform, mobile-first, no listing fees, free
shipping vouchers.
- Stage 4: Thousands of vendors joined, especially during MCO (COVID-19), leading
to huge growth.
- Stage 5: Customer buying habits shifted online; traditional vendors had to adapt or
risk closing. Lazada and others copied Shopee’s model (free shipping, campaigns).
- Stage 6: Vendors now use a hybrid model (offline + online). Customers expect
discounts and online purchasing as a norm.

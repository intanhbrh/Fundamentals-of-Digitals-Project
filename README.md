## üè™ Vendor Journey Summary

| Stage | Description                                                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Vendors relied on *pasar malam* and local *kedai runcit* with limited exposure.                   |
| 2     | Lazada/eBay were available but costly and not micro-vendor-friendly.                              |
| 3     | Shopee launched a free-to-join, mobile-first platform with free shipping vouchers.                |
| 4     | Thousands joined during MCO (COVID-19), causing huge growth.                                      |
| 5     | Customer buying habits shifted online; competitors copied Shopee's model.                         |
| 6     | Vendors now use a hybrid (offline + online) model. Customers expect online discounts as the norm. |
